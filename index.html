 Many malware analysts found that this DcRat tool can install many types of malware and rats and runs it in the background so the victim can't notice what's going on in his device.<br><br>
         It also disables any kind of task inspecting tool like the taskbar, end task, kill task, etc.

<p id="Agent"> What is Snip3 RAT And projFUD.PA</p>
    
    <p id="small1">      
       Snip3 is a highly evasive rat loader that can bypass Antimalware, malware detection tools and other malware blockers also it can manipulate all of these as well to run things smoothly.
	   <br><br>
	   Snip3 uses custom RATS like Async Rat, Revenge RAT, Agent Tesla, etc.
       <br><br>
	   It Starts With Powershell Script or Visual basic Script and does some fileless things and compiles run PE file with variables and executes it as its decompressed with gzip and gets the c# ( C sharp ) code And runs it with .NET.
	   <br> <br>
	   It comes with the [.PS1] extension which can be anything like edgeUpdate.PS1 , WinUpdater32.PS1 etc.

	   <br><br>
	   projFUD.PA uses that the precompiled dll to gives us pde of user snip as his name sn1p3.
